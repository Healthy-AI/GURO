# GURO

This repository contains the implementations of GURO, BayesGURO, and all other algorithms used in the paper [Active Preference Learning for Ordering Items In- and Out-of-Sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03059), published in NeurIPS 2024.

## Running the code

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$Â python plots.py
```

Run plots.py to reproduce Figure 4 in the Appendix. The number of seeds can be reduced if the process is taking too much time. Do this by changing ```n_seeds```. The same implementations of the algorithms have been used when performing all other experiments.
